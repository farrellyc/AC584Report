## 1. Introduction


*Healthcare access* and *utilization* are essential components of ensuring the well-being of populations, particularly among vulnerable groups such as *children under the age of 5*. However, *disparities* in healthcare-seeking behavior based on *gender* can significantly impact health outcomes and access to necessary medical interventions. In this analysis, we delve into the **gender disparities** in *care-seeking behavior* for *febrile children*, examining trends and patterns across various countries. Through visualizations such as *bar charts* and *scatter plots*, we aim to shed light on the differences in healthcare utilization between *males* and *females*, highlighting key insights that can inform policies and interventions aimed at promoting equitable access to healthcare services.

**Overview of Careseeking Behavior for Febrile Children**

- This map provides an *overview* of the **average percentage** of children under the age of 5 who sought advice or treatment from a health facility or provider when experiencing fever across various countries from **2004 to 2022**.

- The color intensity on the map represents the level of careseeking behavior, with **darker shades** indicating higher percentages. 

- This visualization can help gain insights into regional disparities and progress in healthcare access for febrile children. 

- *Trends over time* can be compared, with careseeking rates across African countries highlighting as the lowest.






## 3. Time Series Analysis  

```{r}
# Sample data (replace with your actual dataset)
set.seed(123)
years <- 2006:2021
males <- c(0.646, 0.728, 0.6145, 0.6145, 0.5351, 0.5527, 0.5735, 0.6172, 0.5593, 0.6308, 0.6041, 0.6304, 0.6341, 0.6528, 0.6556, 0.7940)
females <- c(0.6185, 0.6448, 0.5520, 0.5981, 0.5228, 0.5444, 0.5624, 0.6007, 0.5708, 0.6265, 0.5997, 0.6291, 0.6216, 0.6640, 0.6480, 0.802)

data <- data.frame(year = years, males = males, females = females)

# Reshape data to long format
data_long <- tidyr::pivot_longer(data, cols = c(males, females), names_to = "sex", values_to = "care_seek_percentage")

# Plotly plot
p <- ggplot(data_long, aes(x = year, y = care_seek_percentage * 100, color = sex, group = sex)) +
  geom_line(size = 1.5) +
  labs(x = "Year", y = "Care-seeking Percentage (%)", color = "Sex", title = "Gender Disparities in Care-seeking Percentages by Year") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom") +  theme(panel.background = element_rect(fill= "lightblue"), plot.background = element_rect(fill = "lightblue"))

# Convert to plotly
ggplotly(p)
```

- **The line chart** provides an insightful visualization of *gender disparities* in *care-seeking behavior* for *febrile children* across the globe from *2006 to 2022*. Initially, there was a noticeable trend indicating that *males sought care more frequently* than *females*, suggesting potential disparities in healthcare access or cultural factors influencing help-seeking behaviors. 

- However, as the years progressed, there was a notable *convergence* in care-seeking rates between genders, indicating a shift towards **gender parity** in healthcare-seeking behavior. This trend towards parity suggests potential improvements in healthcare access, awareness, and societal norms surrounding caregiving responsibilities. 

- The *visualization* serves as a compelling illustration of evolving healthcare dynamics and the importance of addressing gender disparities in healthcare access and utilization.







## 4. Scatter Plot Correlation

```{r}
# Scatter plot
vis_3 <- data_join %>%
  group_by(country) %>%
  summarise(
    Avg_Life_Expectancy = mean(`Life expectancy at birth, total (years)`, na.rm = TRUE),
    Obs_value_avg = mean(obs_value, na.rm = TRUE)
  ) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Avg_Life_Expectancy, y = Obs_value_avg, color = country)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, size = 0.6, color = "black") +
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0, NA)) +  
  labs(
    y = "Average Life Expectancy (years)",
    x = "Average Care-Seeking Value",
    title = "Correlation Between Life Expectancy and Care-Seeking for Febrile Children"
  ) +  theme(panel.background = element_rect(fill= "lightblue"), plot.background = element_rect(fill = "lightblue"))

  

ggplotly(vis_3)   


```





**Positive Correlation Between Life Expectancy and Care-seeking Behavior**

- The scatter plot visualizes the *positive correlation* between **life expectancy at birth** and the **percentage of caregivers seeking care** for febrile children across various countries. 

- Each data point on the scatter plot corresponds to a specific country, with the visualization revealing a **clear upward trend**. This suggests that regions with higher life expectancy tend to have higher rates of care-seeking for febrile children under the age of 5.

- This correlation underscores the *importance of healthcare access* and utilization in **improving child health outcomes** and overall life expectancy.




## 5. Bar Chart of Gender Disparities
```{r}
#Bar Chart

library(ggplot2)
library(plotly)

# Input your own percentages for the five countries
countries <- c("Sri Lanka", "Tuvalu", "Nauru", "Albania", "Yemen")
male_percentage <- c(0.8955, 0.8765, 0.697, 0.824, 0.618)
female_percentage <- c(0.376, 0.7085, 0.595, 0.3680, 0.2940)

# Create a data frame
data <- data.frame(
  country = rep(countries, each = 2),  # Repeat each country twice
  sex = rep(c("Male", "Female"), times = length(countries)),  # Specify sex labels for each country
  percentage = c(male_percentage, female_percentage)
)

# Convert to plotly
p <- ggplot(data, aes(x = country, y = percentage, fill = sex)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
  labs(x = "Country", y = "Care-Seeking Percentage", fill = "Gender", title = "Gender Disparities in Careseeking for Febrile Children 2006-2022") +
   theme(panel.background = element_rect(fill= "lightblue"), plot.background = element_rect(fill = "lightblue"))
 
  

ggplotly(p)
```

- **The bar chart** above, along with the preceding analysis of the line chart, both shed light on *gender disparity* in healthcare-seeking behavior.

- The bar chart focuses specifically on *five countries* and illustrates the gender disparities in *care-seeking for febrile children* across these nations. It compares the percentages of male versus female careseekers, providing insights into the gender gaps in healthcare behavior.

- Significant disparities are evident across the countries. For instance, in *Tuvalu*, females seek care *13% more frequently* than males, indicating a considerable gender gap in healthcare utilization. Conversely, in other countries like *Sri Lanka*, the results show a more balanced distribution of care-seeking behavior between genders.




## 6. Conclusion


In *conclusion*, the visualizations presented in this analysis provide valuable insights into the **gender disparities** in *healthcare-seeking behavior* for *febrile children*. The findings underscore the importance of **addressing these disparities** to ensure **equitable access** to healthcare services for all individuals, regardless of gender. As evidenced by the **convergence** in care-seeking rates over time and the notable differences highlighted in the bar chart analysis, there is a *pressing need* for **targeted interventions** and policies aimed at promoting **gender parity** in healthcare access. By addressing these disparities, we can strive towards a more *inclusive* healthcare system that prioritizes the well-being of all individuals, particularly the most *vulnerable* members of society.
